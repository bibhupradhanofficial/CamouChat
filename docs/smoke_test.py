# Steps to automate platforms via camouchat.

# Step 1  : Understand & Create a Profile from BrowserManager's ProfileManager

# Get a Object of ProfileManager
pm_obj = ProfileManager()

# Create a Profile with a name u want to add for your profile
work_profile: ProfileInfo = pm_obj.create_profile(
    platform=Platform.WHATSAPP,

    # or Any Platform available in the Platform class
    profile_id="Work",
    # ------------- This is a Required parameter -------------
    # This is your profile name for that platform.
    # Also name is fixed and same platform cannot have same profile name.
    # Ex : "Work"  ,  "woRk"  would not work , they are considered as same.
    # Case insensitivity is used so that it is easy to organize & profiles user-friendly to access.
)

"""
This work_profile we just created is actually a ProfileInfo dataclass
which contains all the information your profile needs.
"""

# Now that you have ur Profile Created we can create a browser with sandboxed to keep profile systems in isolation.

    # Use BrowserManager's Internal class for to give platform attribute anywhere.

    #     # }
    "addons": [],
    # Accepts List[str] , the str should be the real zip download path of addons | Extensions download in ur system,
    # It loads those Extensions in the browser , Making Browser More stealth.
    "fingerprint_obj": BrowserForgeCompatible().get_fg(profile=work_profile),
    # ------------- This is a Required Parameter -------------
    # Accepts single parameter "profile" of type "ProfileInfo"
    # This fingerprint is a BrowserForge Integration .
    # This Automatically uses the path in the dataclass given.

# --- Lets proceed with our browser launch & getting our page from it & then opening a Bot for the available Platforms.
# Remember we had a Platform class in BrowserManager , We can only make Bots | Agents for those platforms only.
