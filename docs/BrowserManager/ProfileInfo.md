# 📂 ProfileInfo: Your Profile's Identity Card

The `ProfileInfo` class is a simple **Data Class** that acts like an identity card for your profile. It holds all the important paths and metadata that the SDK needs to know about a specific profile (like where its messages are stored, where its cache is, and whether it's currently active).

When you create or fetch a profile using the `ProfileManager`, you get one of these objects back. You don't usually need to create it yourself manually, but it's very useful for accessing profile-specific data!

### 🛠️ Attributes inside ProfileInfo

Here’s a breakdown of what’s inside your `ProfileInfo` object:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `profile_id` | `str` | **Required.** The unique name you gave to your profile (e.g., "Work" or "Personal"). |
| `platform` | `Platform` | **Required.** The platform this profile belongs to (e.g., `Platform.WHATSAPP`). |
| `is_active` | `bool` | Tells you if this profile is currently running in a browser. |
| `profile_dir` | `Path` | The root directory on your disk where all profile data is stored. |
| `database_path` | `Path` | The exact path to the `messages.db` (SQLite) file for this profile. |
| `fingerprint_path` | `Path` | Path to the browser fingerprint file (`fingerprint.pkl`) that keeps your browser unique. |
| `encryption` | `dict` | Details about whether encryption is enabled and which algorithm is being used. |
| `created_at` | `str` | The timestamp of when you first birthed this profile! |
| `last_used` | `str` | When the profile was last "touched" by the SDK. |

### 📂 Media & Cache Folders

The `ProfileInfo` also keeps track of separate folders for different types of media to keep your data organized:

*   **`media_images_dir`**: Where all those WhatsApp images go.
*   **`media_videos_dir`**: Your video storage path.
*   **`media_voice_dir`**: Path for voice notes and audio.
*   **`media_documents_dir`**: Where PDFs and documents are saved.
*   **`cache_dir`**: Temporary browser cache files (safe to clear if needed).

### 💡 Pro Tip
You can easily check where your profile lives on your computer by printing the `profile_dir` attribute:
```python
profile = pm_obj.get_profile(Platform.WHATSAPP, "Work")
print(f"My profile is stored at: {profile.profile_dir}")
```

This is the core "State" object of your bot. If you have this object, you have the keys to that profile's kingdom! 🗝️
